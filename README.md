# spacex-project

## Background:
Space X's Falcon 9 rocket launches cost 62 million dollars. While other
providers cost upward of 165 million dollars. The difference in cost is
because Space X can reuse the first stage. This information would be useful
for a competitor company to bid against Space X for a rocket launch.

## Problems we want to solve
Knowing how much a launch is going to cause in advance, so a company
can outbid competitors, and whether the first stage can be reused.

## Summary of methodologies
o Data collection & wrangling
o Exploratory data analysis with visualization and SQL
o Interactive visual analysis using Folium and Plotly
o Create predictive models

## Summary of all results
o Gathered the all variables outcome of different launch sites,
boosters, payload, to determine the success rate of the first stage,
and thus determining the cost of a launch
o Tested different prediction methods and evaluated their accuracy
o Logistic Regression is the most accurate and can be used to predict
the outcome of the first stage
